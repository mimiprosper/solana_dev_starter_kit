# Solana Developer Starter Kit 9ja

This an open-source set of beginner tutorials, templates, and demo projects for building Solana dApps using Rust and Anchor, translated into Pidgin. 

## üß† Problem Statement
Despite growing interest in blockchain across Nigeria and Africa, the steep learning curve in building on Solana discourages many developers from getting started. Most existing learning materials are either too advanced or only available in English, excluding a large population of developers in regions Pidgin is the most predominately spoken means of communication.

There is currently no beginner-friendly, localized Solana onboarding kit tailored to the realities and language needs of Nigerian and African developers ‚Äî especially students and self-taught engineers outside major cities.

## üí° What We‚Äôre Building
We‚Äôre building a Solana Developer Starter Kit, an open-source, beginner-friendly education package for African developers that includes:

- üåç Pidgin English Solana Learning Content: Step-by-step tutorials and explainers in Pidgin English, and standard English.

- üßëüèΩ‚Äçüíª Code Templates: Starter templates using Rust + Anchor and JavaScript/TypeScript SDKs.

- üìπ Video Walkthroughs: Localized YouTube tutorial series Pidgin English.

- üß± Mini Projects: Build-to-learn demos like a voting, nfts, crud dApps.

- üìö PDF Guide: Offline-first PDF documentation for students with limited internet access.

Everything will be open-source, hosted on GitHub, and shared with universities, tech communities, and hackathons across Nigeria. 

## ‚úÖ Why This Matters
This starter kit helps localize Web3 education, lowers onboarding barriers, and diversifies the Solana developer base across Nigeria. It will be open-source, community-accessible, and extendable by other language groups and dev circles across Africa.
